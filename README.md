## How does it work?

- Running the "Game.java" file, the game's start menu will pop up.
- From there we can either Quit, look at the instructions menu by pressing the Help button, or starting the game by pressing the Play button.
- After pressing play, the difficulty setting menu will show up, where we are prompted to choose to play on Normal or Hard mode.
- The players is controled by the WASD keys.
- The objective of the game is to avoid the different enemies that spwan in as we progress with the levels, until we get to the final boss of the game. From there we need to survive until the end in order to win.
- To increase the chances of winning, there is an in-game shop, where with the accumulated points from playing we can buy different upgrades to either increase the total amount of health or the speed of the player, or to refill the health bar.
